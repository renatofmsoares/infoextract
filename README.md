This program was initially designed to extract the glossary of ISTQB terms into text files.

To download dependencies, use the command "yarn" or "npm install".

In this first version the program is still all in a temporary file and can be executed with the command "node tmp.js".

In the next iterations, I want to apply:
  - function to query the number of pages available;
  - function that captures all terms contained from page zero to a specific page.
